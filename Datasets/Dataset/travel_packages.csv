The Golden Circle tour allows you to visit some of Iceland‘s most stunning sights, Geysir geothermal area, the waterfall Gullfoss, and the UNESCO site Þingvellir National Park as well as to learn about growing vegetables in a country which doesn’t get much daylight for most of the year. Geysir geothermal area is in South Iceland, near Laugarvatn Lake. The area is named after the biggest, and now mostly dormant, geyser Geysir and all geysers in the world owe their name to it. The biggest attraction today is the active Strokkur, which shoots up a column of water up to 30 metres (98 ft.) into the air every few minutes. Gullfoss is one of the most famous waterfalls in Iceland and rightly so. The three-step waterfall is a part of the glacial river Hvita and falls into a 62-metre (105 ft.) deep canyon. For the first half of the 20th century, there were ideas about using the waterfall to generate electricity, but thankfully nothing came of it. The UNESCO site Þingvellir National Park is geologically and historically significant. Apart from being the location of the oldest parliament in the world, Alþingi, it is also a place where you can see the Mid-Atlantic ridge above ground. The Eurasian and North -American tectonic plates pull the country apart by a couple of centimeters per year.

	Today after breakfast, you will check out from your hotel in Athens and transferred to Piraeus port for your ferry embarkation to Mykonos Island. Mykonos sits amidst the Aegean Sea like a unique Jewell handcrafted by time, the Greek sun and an anonymous local craftsman. All that can be said or written about Mykonos would be just too little. For centuries Mykonos existed under the shade of the religious centre of Delos and it had to wait until the 20th century to reach its international status and win a place on the world tourist map. 
	Mykonos,  famously called 'the island of the winds' due to the constant wind that blows, is the most popular and cosmopolitan island of the Cyclades and considered as one the most famous islands of the world. The sunlight of Mykonos from its first sunshine of dawn all the way to its last of the sunset is astonishing and supplements an atmosphere of images that seem to have sprung out of a painting. Arrival in Mykonos and transferred at your hotel. Rest of the day is free in order to explore the island.

	Welcome to Iceland - the land of Fire and Ice. Arrival in Iceland and transfer on your own to your hotel (transfer can be pre-booked in advance). Take a stroll in the center of this small town, which is also the capital located to the north of the world. You can ask at the reception of your hotel for a wakeup call show of the Northern Light. Overnight in the Klettur Hotel or similar.
	Breakfast in the hotel. Enjoy the Golden Circle Excursion. The Golden Circle tour allows you to visit some of Iceland‘s most stunning sights, Geysir geothermal area, the waterfall Gullfoss, and the UNESCO site Þingvellir National Park as well as to learn about growing vegetables in a country which doesn’t get much daylight for most of the year. Geysir geothermal area is in South Iceland, near Laugarvatn Lake. The area is named after the biggest, and now mostly dormant, geyser Geysir and all geysers in the world owe their name to it. The biggest attraction today is the active Strokkur, which shoots up a column of water up to 30 metres (98 ft.) into the air every few minutes. Gullfoss is one of the most famous waterfalls in Iceland and rightly so. The three-step waterfall is a part of the glacial river Hvita and falls into a 62-metre (105 ft.) deep canyon. For the first half of the 20th century, there were ideas about using the waterfall to generate electricity, but thankfully nothing came of it. The UNESCO site Þingvellir National Park is geologically and historically significant. Apart from being the location of the oldest parliament in the world, Alþingi, it is also a place where you can see the Mid-Atlantic ridge above ground. The Eurasian and North -American tectonic plates pull the country apart by a couple of centimeters per year.
	
		
			
				Breakfast in the hotel. Enjoy the South Shore Excursion. South Iceland is special for that it is one of the flattest regions on the island. Because of that, most of all grain farming in Iceland is done there. The high mountains to the north, shield the area from the harshest winds from the north.

The beautiful sand and shallow, clear water are well-suited to relaxing beach days under the sun; the beautiful underwater scenery lends itself well to snorkelling or scuba diving; the widespread bay means that you can easily try out some surfing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, or jet skiing without disturbing others; and finally, the numerous excursions and rental options here mean that the only limit is what you want to spend your day doing. 
				 
				Beau Vallon is also worth a visit in the evening thanks to the beautiful sunset views over the water, as well as the local restaurants and bars, including a nightclub, that can be found next to the beach. With such a variety of different things to do, it’s little wonder that Beau Vallon is so well-known by tourists and locals alike, and this beach is one of the few ‘must-see’ locations for any Seychelles vacationer.

With a population of just over 2000 and a rich flora, La Digue is home to one of the rarest birds on earth - the Paradise Flycatcher. Known for preserving traditions, the island’s ‘trademark’ is the must-visit l’Union Estate, still sporting its traditional coconut oil mill, the old copra kiln and a fine colonial house set amongst vanilla and coconut plantations. 
	As you stroll along, pet the gentle giant land tortoises before settling
	down on the picturesque Anse Source d’Argent, voted as one of the most beautiful beaches in the world.

Geysir geothermal area is in South Iceland, near Laugarvatn Lake. The area is named after the biggest, and now mostly dormant, geyser Geysir and all geysers in the world owe their name to it. The biggest attraction today is the active Strokkur, which shoots up a column of water up to 30 metres (98 ft.) into the air every few minutes. Gullfoss is one of the most famous waterfalls in Iceland and rightly so. The three-step waterfall is a part of the glacial river Hvita and falls into a 62-metre (105 ft.) deep canyon. For the first half of the 20th century, there were ideas about using the waterfall to generate electricity, but thankfully nothing came of it. The UNESCO site Þingvellir National Park is geologically and historically significant. Apart from being the location of the oldest parliament in the world, Alþingi, it is also a place where you can see the Mid-Atlantic ridge above ground. The Eurasian and North -American tectonic plates pull the country apart by a couple of centimeters per year.

		Arrival in Whistler. The drive north from Vancouver to Whistler is stunning. It’s dubbed the Sea to Sky Highway and although it’s only a two-hour trip, we recommend taking all day because of the stellar must-see attractions en route. Once in Whistler, enjoy the alpine resort’s all-season activities. Whatever the season its the activities that make people flock here.
		 
	
		Start your day with PEAK 2 PEAK, world’s longest and highest gondola ride, stretching kilometers between the two mountains some 435 meters up. The views through its large windows are outrageous, and some gondola cars even have a glass floor. Ride any time of year to sightsee, spot wildlife, or hop between peaks, and dine at one of the five restaurants up top. Waffles with a view on the patio of log-cabin-style Crystal Hut are a must. Cafeteria-style Roundhouse Lodge is another popular choice for its food courts serving pretty much any international cuisine you can think of.  There’s a gallery explaining the sophisticated engineering behind PEAK 2 PEAK and a 2010 Winter Games display, plus a cinema screening alpine films. Summer and fall are optimal for over 50 kilometers of hikes and walks from the top, especially the popular half-day High Note Trail. Later,  fly through the forest on an exhilarating high wire adventure, no experience required. Glide over spectacular creeks and through majestic old-growth trees on a guided tour. In the evening, stroll through the Whistler Village.  In winter, the covered walkways let you meander from gallery to shop without slipping and sliding alongside skiers and snowshoers.  In summer, the cobblestone streets are lined with bountiful floral baskets and filled with busker entertainment.
		 
	 
	
		Journey deep into the backcountry as your ride on tight bush and open forest trails to a remote alpine cabin nestled on a serene mountain lake. As you relax after your ATV ride, you'll be able to take in the scenery and kick back, all while enjoying a BBQ lunch at your own private oasis. This tour  the perfect group outing for families & friends. Later, ride the melt water from the mountains on a fast, fun whitewater rafting tour. Paddle hard or hold on and enjoy the ride while certified guides navigate you safely through the rapids. Tours include transportation to and from Whistler, wetsuit, gear, professional guide and lunch on full day tours.

The Golden Circle tour allows you to visit some of Iceland‘s most stunning sights, Geysir geothermal area, the waterfall Gullfoss, and the UNESCO site Þingvellir National Park as well as to learn about growing vegetables in a country which doesn’t get much daylight for most of the year. Geysir geothermal area is in South Iceland, near Laugarvatn Lake. The area is named after the biggest, and now mostly dormant, geyser Geysir and all geysers in the world owe their name to it. The biggest attraction today is the active Strokkur, which shoots up a column of water up to 30 metres (98 ft.) into the air every few minutes. Gullfoss is one of the most famous waterfalls in Iceland and rightly so. The three-step waterfall is a part of the glacial river Hvita and falls into a 62-metre (105 ft.) deep canyon. For the first half of the 20th century, there were ideas about using the waterfall to generate electricity, but thankfully nothing came of it. The UNESCO site Þingvellir National Park is geologically and historically significant. Apart from being the location of the oldest parliament in the world, Alþingi, it is also a place where you can see the Mid-Atlantic ridge above ground. The Eurasian and North -American tectonic plates pull the country apart by a couple of centimeters per year.

	Welcome to Iceland - the land of Fire and Ice. Arrival in Iceland and transfer on your own to your hotel (transfer can be pre-booked in advance). Take a stroll in the center of this small town, which is also the capital located to the north of the world. You can ask at the reception of your hotel for a wakeup call show of the Northern Light. Overnight in the Klettur Hotel or similar.
	Breakfast in the hotel. Enjoy the Golden Circle Excursion. The Golden Circle tour allows you to visit some of Iceland‘s most stunning sights, Geysir geothermal area, the waterfall Gullfoss, and the UNESCO site Þingvellir National Park as well as to learn about growing vegetables in a country which doesn’t get much daylight for most of the year. Geysir geothermal area is in South Iceland, near Laugarvatn Lake. The area is named after the biggest, and now mostly dormant, geyser Geysir and all geysers in the world owe their name to it. The biggest attraction today is the active Strokkur, which shoots up a column of water up to 30 metres (98 ft.) into the air every few minutes. Gullfoss is one of the most famous waterfalls in Iceland and rightly so. The three-step waterfall is a part of the glacial river Hvita and falls into a 62-metre (105 ft.) deep canyon. For the first half of the 20th century, there were ideas about using the waterfall to generate electricity, but thankfully nothing came of it. The UNESCO site Þingvellir National Park is geologically and historically significant. Apart from being the location of the oldest parliament in the world, Alþingi, it is also a place where you can see the Mid-Atlantic ridge above ground. The Eurasian and North -American tectonic plates pull the country apart by a couple of centimeters per year.

Among the stops on this tour are at the gorgeous Seljalandsfoss and Skogafoss waterfalls. Seljalandsfoss is part of the Seljandsa river, which has its origins in Eyjafjallajokull glacier.

				After a leisurely breakfast we would recommend visiting one or two of the pristine 65 beaches in Mahe, our suggestion- Beau Vallon Beach. One of the longest beaches in the Seychelles, Beau Vallon is popular amongst tourists and locals thanks to its mixture of beautiful scenery, extensive activity options, fantastic surrounding infrastructure, and widespread appeal. The sheer choice of different activities at Beau Vallon is unique in the Seychelles. The beautiful sand and shallow, clear water are well-suited to relaxing beach days under the sun; the beautiful underwater scenery lends itself well to snorkelling or scuba diving; the widespread bay means that you can easily try out some surfing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, or jet skiing without disturbing others; and finally, the numerous excursions and rental options here mean that the only limit is what you want to spend your day doing. 
				 
				Beau Vallon is also worth a visit in the evening thanks to the beautiful sunset views over the water, as well as the local restaurants and bars, including a nightclub, that can be found next to the beach. With such a variety of different things to do, it’s little wonder that Beau Vallon is so well-known by tourists and locals alike, and this beach is one of the few ‘must-see’ locations for any Seychelles vacationer.
				Overnight at Hotel
	After breakfast, you have the rest of the day at leisure. We recommend visiting the nearby islands of Praslin or La Digue. 
	La Digue is the fourth largest island of the Seychelles group. Here, time stands still and the use of bicycles and ox-cart are quite prevalent. With a population of just over 2000 and a rich flora, La Digue is home to one of the rarest birds on earth - the Paradise Flycatcher. Known for preserving traditions, the island’s ‘trademark’ is the must-visit l’Union Estate, still sporting its traditional coconut oil mill, the old copra kiln and a fine colonial house set amongst vanilla and coconut plantations. 
	As you stroll along, pet the gentle giant land tortoises before settling
	down on the picturesque Anse Source d’Argent, voted as one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Set against exceptional rock formation, the place remains a source of inspiration for artists and will simply take away your breath. Relax and take memorable pictures of one of the few natural places in the world where you can hear your heart beating!
	 
	With over 7000 inhabitants, Praslin is the second largest of the archipelago covers an area of over 37sqm. The isle of Praslin boasts one of UNESCO’s World Heritage sites, the renowned Vallée de Mai, believed to be the original ‘Garden of Eden’. As you stroll through this amazing forest, meet the World’s biggest nut, the inspiring Coco de Mer. Your tour will then take you to the exquisite Anse Lazio beach which over recent years has appeared on the list of top 10 beaches in the world and has graced the front page of several publications. Your visit to these two islands will not only be a dream come true, but a memorable experience for you will have been seduced!

				After a leisurely breakfast we would recommend taking a full day tour of Praslin. 
				the isle of Praslin boasts one of UNESCO’s World Heritage sites, the renowned Vallée de Mai, believed to be the original ‘Garden of Eden’. As you stroll through this amazing forest, meet the World’s biggest nut, the inspiring Coco de Mer. Your tour will then take you to the exquisite Anse Lazio beach which over recent years has appeared on the list of top 10 beaches in the world and has graced the front page of several publications. Your visit to these two islands will not only be a dream come true, but a memorable experience for you will have been seduced!
				 Overnight at Hotel
	After breakfast, you have the rest of the day at leisure. We recommend taking our 3 island nature tour today or a tour to the surreal La Digue.
	In our 3 island nature tour, we visit  Cousin Island, one of the smaller granitic islands with it’s highest point been 58 meters above Sea level. In 1975,
	the island was given protection by the Government and became a Special Reserve for seabirds and land birds unique to Seychelles. There is an estimated million seabirds that nest/ breed each year. Continue by boat to Curieuse Island, where you will visit the old Doctor’s House which has been turned into a museum and the pen for rearing giant land tortoises. Later on we will stop for snorkeling off the boat near the St. Pierre Island which is a natural aquarium. Discover the multitudes of corals and fish and if you are lucky swim, with the turtles andthe eagle rays. There are no jetties, so be prepared for wet landing.
	 
	If you take a tour of La digue, be prepared to be amazed by the sheer beauty of this island. La Digue is the fourth largest island of the Seychelles group. Here, time stands still and the use of bicycles and ox-cart are quite prevalent. With a population of just over 2000 and a rich flora, La Digue is home to one of the rarest birds on earth - the Paradise Flycatcher. Known for preserving traditions, the island’s ‘trademark’ is the must-visit l’Union Estate, still sporting its traditional coconut oil mill, the old copra kiln and a fine colonial house set amongst vanilla and coconut plantations. 
	 
	As you stroll along, pet the gentle giant land tortoises before settling down on the picturesque Anse Source d’Argent, voted as one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Set against exceptional rock formation, the place remains a source of inspiration for artists and will simply take away your breath. Relax and take memorable pictures of one of the few natural places in the world where you can hear your heart beating!
	Overnight stay at the hotel
	Wake up to a  beautiful morning. Today is your last day before you head out back to India via your evening flight. We recommend going hiking on your last day, to discover the untouched greenery. There are gorgeous trails which take you through the lush forests which open out to the clear white beaches. You will be blown away by this experience. 
	After exploring Praslin., check out from your hotel, and take your ferry back from the jetty to Mahe where the international airport is.  Travel back to India with exotic memories to last you a lifetime."," 4,792

				After a leisurely breakfast we would recommend visiting one or two of the pristine 65 beaches in Mahe, our suggestion- Beau Vallon Beach. One of the longest beaches in the Seychelles, Beau Vallon is popular amongst tourists and locals thanks to its mixture of beautiful scenery, extensive activity options, fantastic surrounding infrastructure, and widespread appeal. The sheer choice of different activities at Beau Vallon is unique in the Seychelles. The beautiful sand and shallow, clear water are well-suited to relaxing beach days under the sun; the beautiful underwater scenery lends itself well to snorkelling or scuba diving; the widespread bay means that you can easily try out some surfing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, or jet skiing without disturbing others; and finally, the numerous excursions and rental options here mean that the only limit is what you want to spend your day doing. 
				 
				Beau Vallon is also worth a visit in the evening thanks to the beautiful sunset views over the water, as well as the local restaurants and bars, including a nightclub, that can be found next to the beach. With such a variety of different things to do, it’s little wonder that Beau Vallon is so well-known by tourists and locals alike, and this beach is one of the few ‘must-see’ locations for any Seychelles vacationer.

Known for preserving traditions, the island’s ‘trademark’ is the must-visit l’Union Estate, still sporting its traditional coconut oil mill, the old copra kiln and a fine colonial house set amongst vanilla and coconut plantations. 
	As you stroll along, pet the gentle giant land tortoises before settling
	down on the picturesque Anse Source d’Argent, voted as one of the most beautiful beaches in the world.

The Golden Circle tour allows you to visit some of Iceland‘s most stunning sights, Geysir geothermal area, the waterfall Gullfoss, and the UNESCO site Þingvellir National Park as well as to learn about growing vegetables in a country which doesn’t get much daylight for most of the year. Geysir geothermal area is in South Iceland, near Laugarvatn Lake. The area is named after the biggest, and now mostly dormant, geyser Geysir and all geysers in the world owe their name to it. The biggest attraction today is the active Strokkur, which shoots up a column of water up to 30 metres (98 ft.) into the air every few minutes. Gullfoss is one of the most famous waterfalls in Iceland and rightly so. The three-step waterfall is a part of the glacial river Hvita and falls into a 62-metre (105 ft.) deep canyon. For the first half of the 20th century, there were ideas about using the waterfall to generate electricity, but thankfully nothing came of it. The UNESCO site Þingvellir National Park is geologically and historically significant. Apart from being the location of the oldest parliament in the world, Alþingi, it is also a place where you can see the Mid-Atlantic ridge above ground. The Eurasian and North -American tectonic plates pull the country apart by a couple of centimeters per year.

Ride any time of year to sightsee, spot wildlife, or hop between peaks, and dine at one of the five restaurants up top. Waffles with a view on the patio of log-cabin-style Crystal Hut are a must. Cafeteria-style Roundhouse Lodge is another popular choice for its food courts serving pretty much any international cuisine you can think of.  There’s a gallery explaining the sophisticated engineering behind PEAK 2 PEAK and a 2010 Winter Games display, plus a cinema screening alpine films.

	Mykonos,  famously called 'the island of the winds' due to the constant wind that blows, is the most popular and cosmopolitan island of the Cyclades and considered as one the most famous islands of the world. The sunlight of Mykonos from its first sunshine of dawn all the way to its last of the sunset is astonishing and supplements an atmosphere of images that seem to have sprung out of a painting.
